Python, Java, C#, C++
    - multithreading
        - resource intensive (1 MB)
        - maintainable

Node.js
    - Single Threaded Event Loop
    - resource light
    - difficult to maintain (for CPU intensive operations)


Go
    concurrency is a LANGUAGE FEATURE
            go, chan, select, range
        go routines
        Internal scheduler  (built in the runtime)
        thousands of goroutines can be executed in a SINGLE Thread
        ONLY 2 kb / goroutine

    Simple Language
        ONLY 25 keywords
        NO classes (func [behavior], struct [state], interface [abstraction])
            Prefer composition over inheritence
        No access modifiers
        Support for modules
        Package management is builtin as a part of the go tooling infrastructure
        Support for pointers
        Support for Higher order functions
            functions as data
            functions can be assigned to variables
            functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
            functions can be returned as return values


Class
    Blueprint for an object
    Encapsulation of State & Behavior
        Prefer composition over inheritence

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (respresents a Unicode code point)

    array
        fixed length
        of the same type
        use indexer to access the values
        
    slice
    map

4 Type Conversion
    GOLANG do not support implicity type conversion (all type conversions have to be explicit).
    syntax = Type(Value)

5. Closure
